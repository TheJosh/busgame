This is BusGame.

I was bored on the bus one day, and with an hour to waste, asked
my brother-in-law if he thought I could create a game in a single
bus trip.

This is what I managed - although I did also run out of battery
with about 10 mins to go.

So the game is fairly crap, but I don't care. I'll probably put
on github, just for kicks.

Have Fun,
