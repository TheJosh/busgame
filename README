This is BusGame.

I was bored on the bus one day, and with an hour to waste, asked
my brother-in-law if he thought I could create a game in a single
bus trip.

This is what I managed - although I did also run out of battery
with about 10 mins to go.

This is the exact orignal game from that trip. All I have done
is packed it into a zip file. Includes full source. It's pretty
horrible...

To make the game work, you will need to put the PNG images in this
directory:

     C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\

Yeah I know that is the worst thing ever...

So the game is fairly crap, but I don't care. I'll probably put
on github, just for kicks.

Have Fun,
